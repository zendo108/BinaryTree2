# BinaryTree2
This is week 3 Programming 2 Journal code exercise.
In this week the I put this homework together from the following sources.


Primarily from here
[prismoskills.appspot.com](https://prismoskills.appspot.com/lessons/Binary_Trees/Tree_printing.jsp)

And I used the inOrder() method form here
[inOrder()](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2016/08/inorder-traversal-of-binary-tree-in-java-recursion-iteration-example.html)
